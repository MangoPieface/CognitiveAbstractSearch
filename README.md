# Text Analytics API: .NET Standard Client Library & Sample

## Overview
Text Analytics API is a suite of text analytics services built with Azure Machine Learning and offers APIs for sentiment analysis, and key phrase extraction for English text, as well as language detection for 120 languages.

This repository contains the SDK and sample applications that allow you to enter your API key and text to perform the following actions:
- Language identification
- Sentiment analysis
- Key phrase detection

Before you can use the SDK or run the sample applications you will need to have an Azure account and sign up for the Text Analytics API. Instructions for doing so can be found in the [Getting Started guide](/Docs/getting-started.md).

## The Client Library
The client library is a thin C\# client wrapper for Microsoft Text Analytics API. The easiest way to use this client library is to get microsoft.projectoxford.text package from [nuget](http://nuget.org).

Please go to the [.NET Text API Package in Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Text/) for more details.
